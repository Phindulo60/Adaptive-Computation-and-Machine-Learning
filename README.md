# Adaptive-Computation-and-Machine-Learning
This repository will consist of all the programming assessments i had for a Wits University honours course(Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning)

##In Assignment we were required to:
Implement linear regression and see it work on a simple dataset of our
choice. 
Furthermore we what was required is:
1. Basic implementation of linear regression 
2. Exploring the effect of different learning rates on convergence
3. Implementation of feature scaling, feature standardization and regularization for improved
learning
4.  Data visualization to understand the working of algorithm and other steps (applicable to
all the above stages)

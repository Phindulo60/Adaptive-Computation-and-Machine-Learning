# Adaptive-Computation-and-Machine-Learning
This repository will consist of all the programming assessments i had for a Wits University honours course(Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning)

##In Assignment 1 we were required to:
Implement linear regression and see it work on a simple dataset of our
choice. 
Furthermore what was required is:
1. Basic implementation of linear regression 
2. Exploring the effect of different learning rates on convergence
3. Implementation of feature scaling, feature standardization and regularization for improved
learning
4.  Data visualization to understand the working of algorithm and other steps (applicable to
all the above stages)


##In Assignment 1 we were required to:
Implementing a neural network from first principles and exploring use of different
activation functions and different network architectures.
Furthermore what was required is:
1.  Basic implementation of neural network trained using back-propagation
- Provide clear comments for each sections/phases of your code. 
2. Exploring the effect of different activation functions 
- You are required to implement at least two activation functions and provide visualizations
to help understand their impact/use.
3. Exploring the effect of network size on generalizability (eg. number of hidden layers,
number of hidden neurons)
- You are required to explore at least two options (eg. two hidden layers vs one hidden
layer, x neurons vs y neurons in the hidden layer/layers)
4. Effective use of data visualization and analysis of the results to understand the working
of algorithm and other steps
- This is applicable to all the above stages. eg. learning curves, no. of hidden layers/neurons vs convergence, activation functions etc. 5 points will be allocated to each of the above 3 stages.
